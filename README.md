This project is about Sorting algorithms & Big O in C

## General

Sorting Algorithm
-------------------

these are methods of arranging ellements of a list in a specific order

Big O || Big O notation
-------------------------

This is the matric for determining the efficiency of an algorithm where it allows programmers to
estimate how long their code will run on different set of inputs as it increases or grows.

- In this project Betty style is used for the codes
- The prototypes of all the functions are included in a header file called sort.h
